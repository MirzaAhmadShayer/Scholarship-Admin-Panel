# Scholarship-Admin-Panel
#Java Swing
#PHPMyAdmin

This is a scholarship admin panel system, where an admin can approve, disapprove or keep the decision pending on the scholarship of students.

This is made in Java Swing and the database is in PHPMyAdmin.

There are 3 types of scholarship, Financial Aid, Merit Based or Previous Results Based. When the scholarships are clicked the table shows the students with those
scholarships. For each type of scholarship, different colums with various attributes are shown. 

After choosing the scholarship type, we put a tick mark on the scholarship type we have selected and then we write the ID of the student, change the decision then
write the reason. The table will be updated after we submit the changes. A note is given that we have to tick the chosen scholarship if we wish to update the table
and the database on PHPMyAdmin.
